For the alchemy script, all you have to do is open the game client, run the code, then input the clicking intervals as well as the number of clicks you wish to do.  After that you can just leave the mouse at alchemy spell.

For the mining and woodchopping script:
Run whatever script you want, and then enter the ID of the object you wish to interact with.
The program will then look for the object, either a tree or a rock, of the same type within the vicinity and interact with the object to collect the resource and level up the skill.  You can also choose to drop the items when your inventory becomes full.
The program itself will use a randomly generated clicking interval for you.  This is to help the user evade the adversarial bot detector employed by Jagex.  No need for user input here.
